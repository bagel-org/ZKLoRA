### ZKLoRA: Verifiable LoRA Fine-Tuning with Zero-Knowledge Proofs

Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), have revolutionized the adaptation of large-scale language models for specialized tasks. These methods significantly reduce the computational and memory overhead compared to full fine-tuning, making them highly efficient and practical. However, deploying these techniques in real-world scenarios often presents a **trust dilemma**:

1. **Verification by the Base Model Owner**: A base model owner commissions a LoRA fine-tuning from an external party but needs to verify that the delivered LoRA update is genuinely derived from the specified base model.
2. **Protection for the LoRA Contributor**: The contributor invests substantial resources in fine-tuning and requires assurance of fair compensation without prematurely revealing the LoRA parameters.

To address this dilemma, we introduce **ZKLoRA**, a zero-knowledge protocol that enables secure verification of LoRA updates. ZKLoRA allows a LoRA contributor to prove, in an untrusted environment, that a given LoRA update was derived from a specific base modelâ€”**without exposing the LoRA parameters**.

Key assumptions and innovations include:

- The base model is open source.
- The use of **polynomial commitments** and **succinct zero-knowledge proofs** enables **millisecond-scale verification** for LoRA updates, even for typical large model sizes.

ZKLoRA opens up possibilities for **trustworthy, and verifiable model contributed** in a distributed or contract-based environments. This approach offers a robust path forward for leveraging PEFT methods while maintaining trust and privacy in collaborative AI development.
